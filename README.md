## FAQ

WatchOS related files may cause reinstallation failure, so we'll skip such files by default.

To preserve WatchOS binaries, use `--keep-watch` switch.

### `frida.NotSupportedError: unexpected error while probing dyld of target process`

Double click home, swipe up to kill the App, retry

### `frida.InvalidOperationError: script is destroyed`

App unexpectly crashed. This will only happen when App is launched by frida.

Start the app on device, wait for the initialization, then retry.
